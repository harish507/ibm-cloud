# Comparative Analysis

When the term Integration Platform-as-a-Service (or iPaaS) emerged, the concept existed for years even before. But iPaaS is simply a representation of a more novel approach to integration across applications, data flows, partners and API management. 

It serves as a platform to connect multiple enterprise applications within a single business system together, through seamless integrations.

An iPaaS runs in the cloud and offers lesser complexity. Integrating SaaS applications could simply be point-and-click, with no software to deploy locally. Essentially, iPaaS is a class of PaaS for application and data integration.

Enterprise iPaaS platforms comprise of multiple integration technologies, each suitable for different use cases. This could cause some confusion for the less technically proficient customers, and then there is always the risk of buying more capabilities than what is needed.
