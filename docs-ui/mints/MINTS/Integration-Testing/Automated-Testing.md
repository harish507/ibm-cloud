# Automated Testing

## Why Automated Testing is more reliable than manual testing?

In the **MINTS testing framework** users can able to automate and execute the multiple test cases at a time.
Basically, Manual Testing is performed by involving a human in executing the test case executions.

MINTS Automation Testing is a software testing technique that performs using special automated testing that executes a **bulk of test cases at a time**.

The MINTS Automation testing software can also enter **test data** into the **System Under Test**, compare **expected and actual results** and generate **detailed test reports**. Successive test case development cycles will require the execution of the same test cases **repeatedly**. Using a MINTS Automation test tool, Test cases can be executed at any time and stored the results for future use. 

The **goal of MINTS Automation testing** is to reduce the number of test cases to be run manually and not to eliminate Manual Testing altogether.
**MINTS Automation testing** is the best way to increase the **effectiveness, test coverage, and execution speed in software testing**.

**Advantages of MINTS Automation testing:**
1.	Test cases that are repeatedly executed to provide the best quality for customers.
2.	Test Cases that are very tedious or difficult to perform manually that can be done and performed well by using MINTS Testing framework.
3.	Reduce the time of test case execution when compared to manual executions.


**Complete the following steps to get started:**
1.	Log on to MINTS application and click on the **Designer tab** and select **Test Case Designer** after you will redirect to the **MINTS Integration testing framework module**.
2.	Open your Integration project and click on **TEST** button to navigate test case page and add some of the test cases and as per your requirement. After adding the test case click on **DEFAULT** button to add the test case to perform test case automation testing.
3.	User can able navigate multiple integration projects and select multiple test cases can be added to automating testing by clicking on the **DEFAULT button**.
4.	Once all the test cases are added to default. These test cases can be executed by navigating to MINTS testing module and click **TEST Defaults** button in the navigation bar.
5.	Click on **Run all default test button** to execute all the test cases which are **DEFAULT option enabled**.
6.	After multiple automation of test cases execution. MINTS Testing framework will provide the complete **test cases result report** with Success/Failure status.
