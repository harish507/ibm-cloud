In MINTS Integration services. A **pattern is a reusability of a solution** that encapsulates a tested approach to solving a **common Architecture, design, or deployment task**.

In MINTS a pattern is also called as the **specification of a predefined flow** and preferred techniques in a **message flow to produce a reliable flow**. 

The advantages of using of predefined patterns increase the development **efficiency and routes can be generated from a set of predefined patterns**.

In MINTS, We can build **custom patterns** such as** File to File, Queue to Queue, Inlet Queue>REST>Outlet Queue, Inlet>PGP Security> Outlet, MTX, XSLT, ITX, Data Mapper**.

Each pattern has values known as pattern parameters that you use to create the pattern that uses in the MINTS application. The pattern parameters that you can configure depending on the specific requirement.

**Complete the following steps to develop an Integration pattern:**
1.	Log on to the MINTS Integration service.
2.	In MINTS UI on the top navigation bar click on **Administrationâ€™s tab > Palettes**.
3.	Click on New palette to create a new pattern.
4.	Provide pattern name and pattern group Input & Outputs Transform, Orchestration, Enrichment.
5.	Click on the **(+) add button** to add the** properties** of the pattern such as Pattern name, Key, Type (Queue), Default, Condition key, Operator, Condition value.
6.	If we want to add transformations such as **ITX, XSLT, MTX, Data Mapper**. select the group as transformation.
7.	Click on choose your icon to provide the **transformation UI** icon to the integration patterns.
8.	Select the **Orchestrations group** to perform **REST-based transform patterns**.
9.	Select the **enrichments group** for the patterns like **PGP security**.
10.	 Click on the **save button** to save the Integration patterns.
11.	In MINTS. Patterns can be displayed while configuring the transformation patterns.
