**How MTX Works :**
MTX produces the two services, those are below.
1. Transformation the data using with inputs files.

**EndPoint:**
http://localhost:8080/xml/service/generate/output?mapName={PurchaseOrder}&projectPath={Products}&cacheEnabled=0&flag=false

**Arguments:** mapName paramater is should mandatory and mapname is PurchaseOrder.xml and projectPath paramater is mandatory ,its indicates the directory, flag paramater is either false or true.if true then MTX framewor  build and java classes files and compiled, if false then no need to generate the java class files.
Inorder to mapper file  having XSD inputdefinition , XSD outputdefinition and inoutformat as like below.

       <configuration>
			<inoutformat>{xml2xml}</inoutformat>
			<inputdefinition>{input.orders.xsd}</inputdefinition>
			<outputdefinition>{output.orders.xsd}</outputdefinition>
	</configuration>

**HTTP Method:** POST

**Body:**



2. Rebuilding the Java classes file if any changes in Inputs.
