**Developing Integrations by using Patterns**

In **MINTS Integration services** provide a feature that process of connecting **disparate systems** to allow **communication and data sharing between them**.

Patterns can be defined as a **predefined flow**. In real-time business data flow scenarios. Patterns play a crucial role to make the data flow **environment stable**.

The advantages of using predefined patterns increase the **development efficiency** and routes can be generated from a set of predefined patterns.

**The main advantages of developing integrations by using patterns:**
1.	Reusability & Reliability
2.	Reduce data flow errors
3.	Time-Saving
4.	Better business decisions
5.	Adaptability
6.	Better compatibility
7.	No multiple tests
8.	Better communications.

Let’s start developing the Integration by using patterns in MINTS

**Complete the following steps to develop an Integration pattern:**

1.	Log on to MINTS Integration service
2.	In MINTS UI on the top navigation bar click on **Designer’s tab > Templates**.
3.	Click on New Template to create a **new pattern**.
4.	Now select a pattern category such as **Basic, Transformation, File I/O, FTP**.
5.	Provide pattern names and descriptions of the patterns.
6.	Drag your pattern properties to **pattern IDE**. So, it will show a **graphical flow picture** of your pattern.
7.	Now select the **INPUT (Source) and OUTPUT(Destinations)**. Such as Inlet, Outlet, File Inlet, File Outlet, Kafka Outlet, FTP Read, FTP Write.
8.	Select transformations such as **ITX, XSLT, MTX, Data Mapper**.
9.	Select the **Orchestrations & Enrichment** like **REST-based scenarios** and it's completely based on your requirement of patterns.
10.	In MINTS you can enable/disable the properties of Integrations patterns. Inlet Queue, Inlet Encoding, Thread Count, Transformation Map name, Outlet Encoding, etc…
11.	Click on the **save button** to save the Integration patterns.
