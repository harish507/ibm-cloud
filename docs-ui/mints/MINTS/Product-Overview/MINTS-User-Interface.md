# MINTS User Interface

  **MINTS UI** makes the  integration process lot more easier where it is designed to coordinate configure with different applications with seamless integrations.

**MINTS Workflow** 

   An **Integration** is a sequence of actions that includes tasks like, receives data from an application, process data & extract information, transforms data/info from one form to another or to a different format, and send data different applications with respective formats. There are different applications which perform these actions. 

   The goal of this UI is to configure these applications to make them seamlessly co-ordinate among themselves to complete the process. The integration contains all the steps to configure these actions.
