Using the capabilities of MINTS, you can quickly connect hybrid environments that are comprised of public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises applications. You can develop integrations by using a "configuration, not coding" approach, with premade integration templates, and rich connectors to speed development time.

MINTS provides businesses of all sizes with integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS). It offers an open-source integration bus to take the pain out of integration. 

MINTS UI allows developers to quickly string together integration flows, implement orchestrations, and perform transformations, thereby accelerating development time. It works together to offer organizations a robust integration solution. More than just an Integration-as-a-Service product, MINTS provides a full set of solutions to help keep businesses connected.

MINTS enables information packaged as messages to flow between different business applications, ranging from large traditional systems through to unmanned devices such as sensors on pipelines.
