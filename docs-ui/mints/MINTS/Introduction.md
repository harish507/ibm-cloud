# Introduction

This document shows you how easy it is to connect applications together, regardless of the message formats or protocols that they support.

The idea behind Miracle Integration Service(MINTS) is to eliminate the complexity of Integration and the flexibility to deploy anywhere within three mouse-clicks. We introduce an integration Platform as a Service (iPaaS) for you without the need for programming skills. By introducing standard nodes, our iPaaS offers a 'No-Coding' environment for Enterprises.  

MINTS enables customers to integrate any combination of cloud and on-premise applications without software, appliances or coding. As an iPaaS solution, MINTS supports real-time integration and elastically scales to meet high-volume needs for Enterprises.

MINTS is a platform, built on for protocol conversion and/or data transformation using Templates. This connectivity means that your diverse applications can interact and exchange data with other applications in a flexible, dynamic, and extensible infrastructure. MINTS routes, transforms, and enriches messages from one location to any other location:

- The product supports a wide range of protocols: WebSphereÂ® MQ, Active MQ, HTTP and HTTPS, REST Service, File.
- It supports a broad range of data formats: XML, JSON etc. You can also define your own data formats.
- It supports many operations, including routing, transforming, filtering, enriching, monitoring, distribution, collection, correlation, and detection.

MINTS and its components are built in a way that everyone, even if they have no experience with ESB and integration, can connect to their data!

Try it yourself and see how easy it is to get started with MINTS. Your personal cloud integration development platform is just a mouse-click away.

MINTS allows all types of integration combinations: Cloud, SaaS or On-Premise applications. No appliances, no software and no coding is needed. Develop, build and deploy your integration solutions from your website to your customers.
